  options: [
    "1 day",
    "2 – 3 days",
    "7 – 10 days",
    "Up to 6 weeks"
  ],
  correct: 1,

  question: "Lochia serosa is expected to appear:",
  options: [
    "Immediately after birth",
    "After lochia rubra and up to day 10",
    "During weeks 3–4 only",
    "At 6 weeks postpartum"
  ],

    "< 2.5 cm of stain in 1 hour",
    "5 cm of stain in 15 minutes",
    "> 10 cm of stain in 2 hours",
    "Completely saturated pad in 15 minutes"
  ],
  correct: 0,
  rationale: "A stain smaller than 2.5 cm in an hour is considered scant; larger or faster saturation requires closer evaluation."
},
{
  id: 18,
  question: "Which cervical change is NORMAL by the end of the first postpartum week?",
  options: [
    "The external os is completely closed",
    "The cervical os remains 1 cm dilated",
    "The cervix regains a round nulliparous shape",
    "Cervical tissue is still markedly edematous and friable"

  question: "Postpartum vaginal rugae generally reappear within:",
  options: [
    "1 week",
    "3 weeks",
    "6 weeks",
    "3 months"
  ],
  correct: 1,
  rationale: "Rugae begin to return by the third week, though they are often flatter than before pregnancy and dryness may persist while lactating."
},
{
  id: 20,
  question: "A non-breast-feeding mother is most likely to experience peak breast engorgement:",
  options: [
    "Within the first 24 hours",
    "Between 3 – 5 days postpartum",
    "At the end of week 2",
    "Only if milk is manually expressed"
  ],
  correct: 1,
  rationale: "Milk production and transient vascular congestion typically distend the breasts 3–5 days after delivery; engorgement then subsides without expression."
},
{
  id: 21,
  question: "In breastfeeding mothers, encouraging on-demand feeds every 2–3 hours helps prevent engorgement primarily by:",
  options: [
    "Stimulating prolactin release",
    "Keeping estrogen levels low",
    "Removing milk and maintaining flow",
    "Lowering maternal temperature"
  ],
  correct: 2,
  rationale: "Frequent emptying prevents over-filling of the alveoli and rapid lymphatic/venous congestion associated with engorgement."
},
{
  id: 22,
  question: "Average blood loss for a *vaginal* delivery is considered normal if it does not exceed approximately:",
  options: [
    "150 mL",
    "300–500 mL",
    "800 mL",
    "1,000 mL"

  question: "Average blood loss during a routine *cesarean* birth is expected to be:",
  options: [
    "≤ 250 mL",
    "300–500 mL",
    "500–1,000 mL",
    "1,500 mL or more"

},
{
  id: 24,
  question: "Immediately after birth, maternal cardiac output rises as much as what percentage over pre-labor values before returning to normal?",
  options: [
    "20–30 %",
    "40–50 %",
    "60–80 %",
    "90–100 %"

},
{
  id: 25,
  question: "The elevated postpartum cardiac output generally returns to pre-pregnancy levels within:",
  options: [
    "48 hours",
    "1 week",
    "2–3 weeks",

  correct: 3,
  rationale: "Leukocytosis to 30,000 mm³ can occur due to stress and tissue repair; the count declines over the first week."
},
{
  id: 27,
  question: "What urinary output pattern is typical during the first 2–3 postpartum days as excess tissue fluid is mobilized?",
  options: [
    "Oliguria (< 400 mL/day)",
    "Up to 3,000 mL of diuresis per day",
    "No change from pregnancy values",
    "Progressive urinary retention"
  ],
  correct: 1,
  rationale: "Profuse diuresis—often 3 litres or more daily—helps eliminate extracellular fluid accumulated during pregnancy."
},
{
  id: 28,
  question: "Post-delivery hematocrit usually drops for 3–4 days and then returns to non-pregnant levels by:",
  options: [
    "End of week 1",
    "End of week 4",
    "8 weeks postpartum",
    "6 months postpartum"
  ],
  correct: 2,
  rationale: "Fluid shifts and erythropoiesis normalize hematocrit by roughly eight weeks in an uncomplicated recovery."
},
{
  id: 29,
  question: "Afterpains caused by intermittent uterine contractions are more commonly perceived by:",
  options: [
    "Primiparous women",
    "Multiparous women",
    "Women with twin gestations",
    "Women who had epidural anesthesia"
  ],
  correct: 1,
  rationale: "Multiparas experience stronger, less-coordinated contractions as the uterus strives to regain tone, producing noticeable cramping."
},
{
  id: 30,
  question: "Severe, new-onset postpartum headaches should be evaluated FIRST to rule out which potentially life-threatening cause?",
  options: [
    "Migraine aura",
    "Cerebrospinal-fluid leak",
    "Preeclampsia",
    "Sinus congestion"
  ],
  correct: 2,
  rationale: "While CSF leaks and tension headaches are common, a high-pressure headache warrants urgent assessment for postpartum pre-eclampsia."
},
{
  id: 31,
  question: "The transient mood disturbance commonly called the 'baby blues' typically resolves within:",
  options: [
    "48 hours",
    "7 days",
    "10–14 days",
    "6 weeks"
  ],
  correct: 2,
  rationale: "Normal emotional lability usually peaks around day 4–5 and fades by the end of the second postpartum week."

  options: [
    "2 weeks",
    "6 weeks",
    "3 months",
    "1 year"
  ],
  correct: 1,
  rationale: "Most women note significant improvement in diastasis by the routine 6-week check-up."

  options: [
    "The first week",
    "Weeks 3–4",
    "The first 3 months",
    "One year postpartum"
  ],
  correct: 2,
  rationale: "Hormonal shifts move many follicles into the resting phase; shedding peaks at roughly three months and resolves spontaneously."
},
{
  id: 35,
  question: "A pulse of 40–50 beats/min in the first 24 hours after birth is usually interpreted as:",
  options: [
    "Sign of hemorrhage",
    "Normal puerperal bradycardia",
    "Pulmonary embolus",
    "Thyroid storm"
  ],
  correct: 1,
  rationale: "Increased stroke volume and decreased vascular resistance commonly produce benign bradycardia during immediate recovery."
},
{
  id: 36,
  question: "Orthostatic hypotension is MOST likely to occur during which period after delivery?",
  options: [
    "First 12 hours",
    "24–48 hours",
    "Day 3–4",
    "After 2 weeks"
  ],
  correct: 1,
  rationale: "Vasomotor instability and blood redistribution make standing dizziness common during the first two postpartum days."
},
{
  id: 37,
  question: "A maternal temperature up to 38 °C (100.4 °F) in the first 24 hours postpartum is usually associated with:",
  options: [
    "Upper-respiratory infection",
    "Normal dehydration and exertion",
    "Endometritis",
    "Urinary-tract infection"
  ],
  correct: 1,
  rationale: "A mild, transient rise is common from exertion and fluid shifts; persistent or higher fevers warrant evaluation for infection."
},
{
  id: 38,
  question: "Which coagulation‐related change contributes to increased risk of thromboembolism in the early puerperium?",
  options: [
    "Platelet destruction",
    "Decreased fibrinogen",
    "Elevated clotting factors II, VII, IX and X",
    "Prolonged prothrombin time"
  ],
  correct: 2,
  rationale: "Coagulation factors remain elevated while peripheral resistance decreases, enhancing clot formation potential until levels normalize."

{
  id: 39,
  question: "A perineal pad completely saturated in **15 minutes** or less with pooling under the buttocks should be interpreted as:",
  options: [
    "Scant lochia—continue routine care",
    "Light lochia—re-check in one hour",
    "Normal for the first day",
    "Postpartum hemorrhage—initiate emergency measures"
  ],
  correct: 3,
  rationale: "Rapid pad saturation signals excessive bleeding requiring immediate assessment, fundal massage and provider notification."

  options: [
    "Diastasis recti",
    "Linea nigra",
    "Striae gravidarum",
    "Rectocele"

  id: 41,
  question: "Bladder distention in the immediate postpartum period is MOST often manifested by:",
  options: [
    "Low back pain only",
    "A soft, boggy fundus above the midline",
    "Minimal lochia drainage",
    "Bradycardia"
  ],
  correct: 1,
  rationale: "A full bladder displaces the uterus upward and to the side, preventing effective contraction and increasing bleeding risk."
},
{
  id: 42,
  question: "Which nursing action helps prevent urinary retention after birth?",
  options: [
    "Restrict fluids for 12 hours",
    "Encourage voiding within 4 hours of delivery",
    "Insert an indwelling catheter routinely",
    "Apply an abdominal binder"
  ],
  correct: 1,
  rationale: "Early assisted ambulation and scheduled voiding promote normal tone and reduce infection or hemorrhage linked with retention."

  id: 43,
  question: "Most women report feeling *very hungry* once anesthesia fully wears off; nonetheless, bowel movements are often delayed for:",
  options: [
    "12 hours",
    "24 hours",
    "2 – 3 days",
    "5 days"
  ],
  correct: 2,
  rationale: "Progesterone, analgesics and reduced tone slow peristalsis; a first stool by day 3 is considered typical."
